// Step 1: Understand the Problem

// Slow down / take a step back
// Ask some clarifying questions:
// Can you restate the problem in your own words?
// What are the inputs and corresponding outputs?
// Can the outputs be determiened from the inputs?
// How should I labe the important parts of tthe problem?

// EXAMPLE: Write a function that takes 2 numbers and returns their sum

// Can you restate the problem in your own words?
// implement addition
// What are the inputs and corresponding outputs?
// numbers; but are they small or large?; int? float? string?
// Can the outputs be determiened from the inputs?

// How should I labe the important parts of tthe problem?
